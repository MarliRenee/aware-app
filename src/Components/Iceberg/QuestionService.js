    question: "In light of all this, who are you?",
    TellMeMoreText: "When faced with the fear that our yearnings might never be met, we often bump into a core false belief about ourselves... When our deepest yearnings are denied, we might assume our needs will never be met. We might fear that connection, affirmation or love will always be outside our grasp. This is not the truth. But it is important to face that fear. Once you have addressed it, respond with a truth. You are a person worthy of love. You are worthy of joy, of connection and purpose. What you yearn for is already available to you.",
