# Aware App React Client

Welcome to the client code for Aware - a cognitive behavioral processing app based on Virginia Satir's iceberg model. The iceberg model uses simple prompts to guide you to greater emotional awareness.

- View the [live app](https://aware-app.vercel.app/)

- Checkout the [server code](https://github.com/MarliRenee/aware-api/tree/checkpoint6) 

- See the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/MarliRenee/projects/1) (along with all my day-dreams for the app).

The app was designed for phones, but will scale for desktop viewing.

You can run through a quick "iceberg" processing flow without signing-in, or register to save your progress and review it in the future. 

## Summary

Aware is a eight-step processing tool designed to help people articulate the emotions behind stressful or unusual events. Satir's iceberg model has been used by CBT therapists for decades, but now users can independentally work through the questions, save completed processing "icebergs" for later referal, and ditch cluttered homework sheets. And save trees!
